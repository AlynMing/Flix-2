### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. Custom cell did not display all labels.
Problem: After creating my custom cell with two labels (title, synopsis) and image, I run it on the simulator but the cell only displayed a fraction of the title.
Even though I changed the height of the cell, it did not fix the problem. After receiving help from the TA and self-debugging, I changed the row height of the "TableViewCell" which resolved my problem.

Solution: Change row height of "TableViewCell"
2. AlamofireImage af_setImage method is deprecated
  Problem: Following the tutorial, I was stuck when seeing the af_setImage was crossed out on my Xcode. I tried to search Google for the new method but couldn't find any. I then decided to use the deprecated method anyway. Then, Xcode suggested me with the new method.

  Solution: Keep using it until Xcode suggest new method, New method: af.setImage(withUrl: URL)
3. CTRL drag does not show segue
Problem: I was attempting to create show movie trailer whenever user click on the poster. I
held "ctrl" on the posterImage and drag it to the VideoViewController but there was nothing
popup to setup the segue.
Attempt:
	x	Tried again
	x	Tried with different elements
	x Restart xcode
	x Create new project and new viewcontrollers
	x Check mark on attribute User Interaction Enable

	v	Tried with button element

-->somehow, ctrl drag only works with button now. BUG IN XCODE???	
Solution:
	1. Create segue from MovieDetailsViewController to VideoViewController
	2. Add UITapGestureRecognizer to posterView in MovieDetailsViewController
	3. Call performSegue when user click on the posterView
